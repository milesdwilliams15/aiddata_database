# aiddata_database
A centralized place for all the aid datasets I use.

## What's here?

As of 02-02-2024, the `_data` folder contains all the files associated with the [most recent core data release by AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1) (version 3.1). The main data files have been saved a .csv files and can be easily read into R by writing the following code: 

```

```

The data are mostly in their raw state, but I've taken some steps to ensure column titles are in an R-friendly format. I've also included a few different columns with one of Correlates of War, Gledisch-Ward, and ISO country codes for donors and recipients.
